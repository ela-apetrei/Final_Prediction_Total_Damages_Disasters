Project Title
# Prediction_Total_Damages_Disasters

Description
This project aims to predict the total damages caused by disasters in order to improve resource allocation in the future. By leveraging historical data on disasters and their associated damages, we develop a model that can provide valuable insights into the potential impact of future disasters. This will enable more efficient and effective allocation of resources, helping to minimize the negative effects of disasters on affected communities.
